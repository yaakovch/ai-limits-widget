# Agent Fleet

Agent Fleet is a local-first Windows tray application for managing personal AI
coding sessions across Windows, WSL, Linux, and Termux. It is growing from AI
Limits Widget into one dashboard for wtmux sessions, launchers, scheduled
messages, host health, attention events, and Codex/Claude usage limits.

The existing transparent, click-through limits overlay remains available as an
optional companion view. Fleet discovery, caches, logs, diagnostics, and the
tray remain metadata-only. Opening an embedded session explicitly starts an
end-to-end session-content channel through the user's WSL/SSH setup; that
terminal and conversation content stays in memory and is never logged or
cached. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## Status

`0.11.0-beta.22` is under active development for a private multi-machine beta.
The existing unsigned `0.9.0-beta.1` release is retained as a legacy
prerelease. Unsigned public builds are manual downloads only; automatic public
updates require trusted signed artifacts.

The source repository is public. The wtmux bridge, personal fleet registry, and
private beta release feed are intentionally separate and private.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, x64
- WSL with at least one Linux distribution
- Codex inside WSL for local limit collection
- wtmux and SSH/Tailscale access for fleet features as they land
- Claude Code for the optional Claude status-line integration

## Embedded Workspace

Open any fleet session in Agent Fleet's vertical Sessions workspace. Assign up
to four sessions to resizable horizontal or vertical splits, switch each pane
independently between Native and Terminal, and restore the layout on restart. Native
view presents supported Codex and Claude conversations as an Android-style
message surface with readable tool activity, approvals, planning questions,
and image attachments. Terminal view exposes the same live tmux session through
ConPTY/xterm.js. Windows Terminal and VS Code remain selectable alternatives.
Each session's More menu can also browse its repository and place a verified
copy of a selected file in Windows Downloads, with search, progress,
cancellation, and Open or Show in folder actions.

## Development

```powershell
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Verification and packaging:

```powershell
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run package:dir
npm run smoke:packaged
npm run package
npm run sbom
npm run finalize:release
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/`. Local and private-beta builds may be
unsigned. Stable public releases require Authenticode signing.

## Settings Transfer

Settings → Import/Export transfers provider and widget configuration in a
versioned JSON envelope. Imports are validated and previewed before replacement.
The previous configuration is backed up and can be restored with Rollback.
Usage caches, logs, window position, Claude settings, and authentication data
are excluded.

## Release Process

Version tags must match `package.json`. The signed public workflow packages and
verifies Authenticode artifacts, updater metadata, checksums, an SBOM, and build
provenance. Private beta builds are manually dispatched from a separate private
feed and always record the exact public source commit. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[implementation_plan.md](implementation_plan.md).
