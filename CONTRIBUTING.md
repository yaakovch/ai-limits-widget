# Contributing

## Local Checks

Run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run package:dir`, and `npm run smoke:packaged` before opening a pull request.

Keep provider authentication outside this repository. Tests and documentation must use generic users and paths such as `/home/testuser`.

## Releases

1. Update `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merge the release commit to `main` after CI passes.
3. Create a matching `vX.Y.Z` or prerelease tag.
4. The release workflow must sign the unpacked application and final artifacts through the configured SignPath project.
5. Verify Authenticode signatures, updater metadata, checksums, SBOM, provenance, install/portable behavior, and the second-machine checklist.
6. Publish the generated draft. `1.0.0` is first published as a prerelease, validated as an update from `0.9`, then promoted unchanged to stable.

SignPath project identifiers and API tokens belong in GitHub Actions secrets. Stable releases must not bypass the signing job.
